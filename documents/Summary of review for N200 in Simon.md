# Simon's N200 in Simon-Stroop combined paradigm

## Introduction

The Stroop effect is produced by the interference of a color-word when naming a different color. Such interference causes an increase in reaction times and error rates (Stroop, 1935).

The Simon effect is produced by the interference of the location of a stimulus when a response has to be made on the opposite side of the stimulus. This interference affects reaction times (Simon, 1969).

There are brain correlates reflecting these effects. One way of observing them is by analysing event-related potentials (ERP), which are electrical activations associated with specific events (Luck, 2014). They can be calculated as the average activation at a specific time window after the onset of a stimulus.

For example, between 200 and 350 ms after the onset of the stimuli in the Simon task, a negative peak can be observed. This ERP is called N200 (Cespón, 2020; Folstein & Van Petten, 2008). The N200 has been detected at fronto-central sites, around the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (Cespón, 2020). The N200 has been related to cognitive control, conflict monitoring and novelty (Folstein & Van Petten, 2008). In the Simon task, the amplitud of the N200 is larger when the trial is inconsistent than when it is consistent (Cespón, 2020; Melara, Wang, Vu, & Proctor, 2008).

The results discussed in the review by Folstein & Van Petten (2008) focused mostly on the fronto-central electrodes Fz and Cz. Likewise, Melara et al. (2008) reported data from the midline frontal (Fz) and the central (Cz) electrodes.

## Objectives

The present task combined the Stroop and the Simon paradigms, but focused on the Simon effect.

Specific objectives:
- Investigate if it the Simon effect can be observed behaviourally by comparing reaction times and error rates
- Testing for the Simon effect by focusing on the N200

## Method

We recruited 11 right-handed participants from different cultural and language backgrounds.
