# Summary of review for N200 in Simon task

## The Simon effect

The Simon Effect: "The Simon effect is the difference in accuracy or reaction time between trials in which stimulus and response are on the same side and trials in which they are on opposite sides, with responses being generally slower and less accurate when the stimulus and response are on opposite sides." From the [Encyclopedia of Neuroscience, 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/simon-effect)


## ERP analysis

N200 is an event-related potential (ERP). It is observed as a negative peak between 200 and 350 ms after the onset of the stimulus (Cespón, 2020; Folstein & Van Petten, 2008).

It has been detected at fronto-central sites, around the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (Cespón, 2020). The N200 has been related to cognitive control, conflict monitoring and novelty (Folstein & Van Petten, 2008).

In the Simon task, the amplitud of the N200 is larger when the trial is inconsistent than when it is consistent (Cespón, 2020; Melara, Wang, Vu, & Proctor, 2008).

The results discussed in the review by Folstein & Van Petten (2008) focused mostly on the fronto-central electrodes Fz and Cz. Likewise, Melara et al. (2008) reported data from the midline frontal (Fz) and the central (Cz) electrodes.
