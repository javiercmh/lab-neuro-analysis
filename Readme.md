# Laboratory rotation neuroscience

This project was done in the context of a laboratory rotation for Neuroscience, for my master's in cognitive science at TU Kaiserslautern.

Data analysis of an experiment combining the Stroop and Simon tasks. The data of the participants was anonymised or aggregated beforehand. Therefore there is no personal information available in this respository.

The analysis focuses on the Simon task and has two parts:

- Behavioural: analysis of response times.
- Electroencephalography (EEG): analysis of the N200 effect.

Enjoy.
